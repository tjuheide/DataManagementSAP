In this example no references will be provided.\n\n## Aim\nTo estimate the 5-year relative risk of plague and cholera after initiation of SGLT2i compared to GLP-1RA, which serves as an active comparator to reduce confounding and is assumed not to affect the risk of either kind of infection.[^2]\n\n[^2]: This is likely a stupid study to conduct in Denmark. That is intentional.\n\n## Sample size\nWe expect the sample size to be 30-60,000 with at least 10,000 individuals in each exposure group.\n\n## Methods\nWe will conduct a new user active comparator study using population-based Danish registry data.\n\n### Data sources\nWe will use data from:\n\n*\tThe Danish National Patient Registry (patient registry)\n*\tThe Danish National Prescription Registry (prescription registry)\n*\tThe Register of Laboratory Results for Research (laboratory registry)\n*\tThe Civil Registration System (CRS)\n\nall of which are well known to the statistical programmer and will not be described or documented further here.[^3]\n\n[^3]: A data dictionary or other forms of documentation can be essential if the data sources are unknown to the statistical programmer, or if data can be made publicly available so that others can reproduce your results.\n\n### Study and recruitment period {#sec-period}\nThe study period will be 1 January 2016 through 31 December 2024.\nThe recruitment period will be 1 January 2016 through 31 December 2021.\n\n### Time\nA month is 30 days, and a year is 360 days.[^4]\n\n[^4]: This might be over the top but at some point your statistical programmer will have to decide on how to compute age, length of follow-up etc. if units of time are unspecified. Avoiding \"months\" will often be a good idea if possible, then a year can be 365 days (or 365.25 days to account for leap years) without having confusion as to how long a month needs to be for a year to equal 12 months.\n\n### Exposure groups\n*\tSGLT2i (exposure)\n*\tGLP-1RA (comparator)\n\n### Study population and index date\nWe will include individuals initiating SGLT2i or GLP-1RA during the study period using the inclusion-/exclusion steps below. The population is restricted to individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because SGLT2i is also indicated for heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We assume that restricting to this specific population of individual with a priori increased risk of infections will reduce confounding. Individuals with heart failure or CKD will not be excluded in the primary analysis.\n\n1.\tExtract data on the exposures from the prescription registry.\n2.\tSelect the first ever date per person, this marks the index date of the individual.\n3.\tExclude individuals who, on the index date:\n    a.\tinitiate both drugs\n    b.\thave incomplete CRS data (sex or date of birth missing)\n    c.\tare aged < 18 years\n    d.\tdo not have T2DM\n    e.\thave type 1 diabetes mellitus\n    f.\thave had either plague or cholera in the previous 3 months\n    g.\tdo not live in Denmark.\n4.\tInclude individuals whose index date lies in the recruitment period.[^5]\n\n[^5]: Note how the dates are not written here - they are defined in @sec-period and we seek to avoid repetitions.\n\nIndividuals will be assigned to exposure groups based on the prescription they received on the index date. At this point, check that there are at least 10,000 individuals in each exposure group. If this is not the case, we need to make sure that the correct codes have been used.\n\n\\[Here you might want to include a study diagram like @fig-studydiagram.[^6] However, it is repetitious by nature and as such it may not serve any particular purpose when the design is simple. If the design is more complex, a study diagram can serve as visual aid in explaining it.\\]\n\n[^6]: The colors and notation in @fig-studydiagram are not the ones typically used. No particular thought has been put into the current design.\n\n![Study diagram](./figs/studydiagram.png){#fig-studydiagram}\n\n### Follow-up and outcomes\nFor plague and cholera (the events of interest), separately, individuals will be followed from their index date until the first of: event of interest, emigration from Denmark, death, end of study period or 5 years, whichever comes first.\n\nSee the Outcomes section in @tbl-codingtable for definitions of plague and cholera. Death and emigration will be captured in the CRS.\n\n### Statistical analyses\nThe flowchart (@fig-flowchart) will be populated.\n\nThe population will be described as outlined in @tbl-tblshell1. Continuous variables will be reported by their median and interquartile intervals (Q1-Q3), while categorical variables will be reported with counts and percentages. For dichotomous variables, only one level will be presented (e.g., only the number of females, not males, and only numbers with prevalent heart failure, not numbers without, will be reported), whereas all levels will be presented for variables with more than two levels.\n\nThe outcomes will be analyzed using time to event methods, applying stabilized inverse probability of treatment (sIPT) weighting and multivariable adjustment to handle confounding. Specifically, sIPT weighted cause-specific Cox regression with confounder adjustment (see below) will be used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for each event of interest, along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The results will be reported as outlined in @tbl-tblshell2. Using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and sIPT-weighting, we will plot absolute risks against time, as outlined in @fig-riskcurves. No crude/unadjusted outcome analyses will be conducted.\n\nThe sIPT weights will be estimated using logistic regression including the exposure as the dependent variable, and the variables listed in @tbl-tblshell1 as independent variables. Continuous variables will be included as restricted cubic splines with knots placed at the deciles of their distributions (to be reconsidered if insufficient balance is achieved after sIPT weighting). Interaction terms will be included for age and sex; age and heart failure; heart failure and duration of T2DM; age and CKD; CKD and duration of T2DM; and country of origin and age.\n\nWe will use absolute standardized mean differences (ASMDs) to assess balance of baseline variables before and after sIPT weighting (@fig-ASMD). All sIPT weighted ASMDs must be below 0.1 and the ASMDs for age, sex, country of origin, heart failure, and CKD must be less than 0.01 to proceed to the outcome analyses. If this is not achieved, possible alternatives[^7] to an overall logistic regression model will be discussed and investigated.\n\n[^7]: Consider specifying.\n\n*Based on the populated versions of @tbl-tblshell1, @fig-flowchart, and @fig-ASMD, the entire author group must agree that the study population is reasonable with respect to size and characteristics, and that balance between exposure groups is sufficient, before any outcome analysis is carried out.*[^8]\n\n[^8]: To prevent p-hacking or HARKing, consider deciding *a priori* on certain intermediate milestones where analyses will be paused, and findings/results so far will be discussed in the group. In this way you can prevent yourself from changing the analyses after seeing the primary results, when it could have been done at an earlier stage.\n\nFor added robustness, sIPT weighting will be combined with multivariable adjustment when applying the cause-specific Cox regression. However, we expect relatively few outcomes, so we will only adjust for sex, age and country of origin, and age will be included as restricted cubic splines with 4 knots placed as suggested by Frank Harrell in Regression modelling strategies.\n\nThe proportionality assumption will be assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. If proportionality cannot be achieved, the 5-year risk estimates from the Aalen-Johansen estimator for each exposure group will be compared to obtain a 5-year risk ratio.[^9]\n\n[^9]: Often this is what you would do anyway when using PS-weighting or -matching. Cox-regression is primarily mentioned to point out that PS-methods can be combined with a multivariable outcome-model.\n\nFor stratified analyses and sensitivity analyses restricted to subgroups, we will re-estimate the sIPT weights. We will assess the balance of baseline variables in these subgroup analyses using ASMDs. However, we will not re-evaluate the methods if sufficient balance cannot be achieved. Instead, any imbalance will be reported in the manuscript or supplementary material. Outcome analyses will be conducted regardless of the ASMD-values.\n\nAll 95% CIs will be estimated using bootstrapping with 500 repetitions.\n\nThe statistical analyses will be conducted using [SAS/R/Stata] version X.X or higher.\n\n#### Missing data\nWe expect the level of missingness to be low.\n\n*\tFor comorbidities and comedication, absence of a record within the lookback period is assumed to be indicative of absence of the condition; missingness will be 0% by definition.\n*\tKnown age and sex are required for inclusion; missingness will be 0% by definition.\n*\tWe include biomarkers that are expected to be measured regularly for individuals with T2DM, missingness is expected to be less than 20% for all biomarkers.\n\nWe will apply multiple imputation,[^10] constructing and analyzing 10 data sets. Results across imputed data sets will be aggregated using Rubin's rule.\n\n[^10]: More details should be provided.\n\n#### Stratified analyses\nWe will estimate risks and conduct cause specific Cox-regressions stratifying on sex, country of origin and age (<65 years versus 65+ years). These results will be reported as outlined in @fig-forestplot. To assess treatment effect heterogeneity, we will include interaction terms for the exposure and each of these variables in separate cause specific Cox models and report the point estimate and 95% CI.[^11]\n\n[^11]: Or however you want to do that. If you simply go for eyeballing you might want to rewrite/shorten this section a bit.\n\n#### Sensitivity analyses\nThese sensitivity analyses are to be applied to the overall analysis only, stratifications will not be repeated within subgroups or in on-treatment analyses. Result will be reported as outlined in @tbl-tblshell3.\n\nWe will conduct a complete case analysis.\n\nAs we lack data on BMI, and we assume GLP-1RA is associated with higher levels of BMI, we will repeat the analysis within individuals with an obesity diagnosis.\n\nWe will restrict the analysis to individuals without a diagnosis of heart failure or CKD, to increase the likelihood that the indication for drug initiation was T2DM.\n\nFinally, we will conduct an on-treatment analysis. For this analysis an individual will be censored on the date they switch from one exposure drug to the other, or if they discontinue the treatment they initiated on the index date (index treatment). Discontinuation will be defined as a period of 120 days with no new prescription of the index treatment.[^12]\n\n[^12]: In an actual study, you might want to do something about informative censoring, e.g., apply inverse probability of censoring weighting.\n\n## Table shells\n\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\n#| label: tbl-tblshell1\n#| tbl-cap: |\n#|   (Naturally, all variables should be listed in a proper SAP.)\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\ntblshell1 <- tibble::tribble(\n                      ~` `, ~SGLT2i, ~`GLP-1RA`,\n                       \"N\",      \"\",         \"\",\n     \"Age, median (Q1-Q3)\",      \"\",         \"\",\n                     \"Sex\",      \"\",         \"\",\n           \"Calendar year\",      \"\",         \"\",\n             \"  2016-2017\",      \"\",         \"\",\n             \"  2018-2019\",      \"\",         \"\",\n             \"  2020-2021\",      \"\",         \"\",\n    \"T2DM characteristics\",      \"\",         \"\",\n \"Duration, years (Q1-Q3)\",      \"\",         \"\",\n  \"Glucose lowering drugs\",      \"\",         \"\",\n                 \"Insulin\",      \"\",         \"\",\n               \"Metformin\",      \"\",         \"\",\n                  \"\\u2026\",      \"\",         \"\",\n           \"Comorbidities\",      \"\",         \"\",\n           \"Heart failure\",      \"\",         \"\",\n  \"Chronic kidney disease\",      \"\",         \"\",\n                  \"\\u2026\",      \"\",         \"\",\n            \"Comedication\",      \"\",         \"\",\n                  \"\\u2026\",      \"\",         \"\"\n)\n\ngt(tblshell1) |>\n  tab_header(title = \"Table shell 1.

provide references throughout the document as is relevant. In this example no references will be provided.\n\n## Aim\nTo estimate the 5-year relative risk of plague and cholera after initiation of SGLT2i compared to GLP-1RA, which serves as an active comparator to reduce confounding and is assumed not to affect the risk of either kind of infection.[^2]\n\n[^2]: This is likely a stupid study to conduct in Denmark. That is intentional.\n\n## Sample size\nWe expect the sample size to be 30-60,000 with at least 10,000 individuals in each exposure group.\n\n## Methods\nWe will conduct a new user active comparator study using population-based Danish registry data.\n\n### Data sources\nWe will use data from:\n\n*\tThe Danish National Patient Registry (patient registry)\n*\tThe Danish National Prescription Registry (prescription registry)\n*\tThe Register of Laboratory Results for Research (laboratory registry)\n*\tThe Civil Registration System (CRS)\n\nall of which are well known to the statistical programmer and will not be described or documented further here.[^3]\n\n[^3]: A data dictionary or other forms of documentation can be essential if the data sources are unknown to the statistical programmer, or if data can be made publicly available so that others can reproduce your results.\n\n### Study and recruitment period {#sec-period}\nThe study period will be 1 January 2016 through 31 December 2024.\nThe recruitment period will be 1 January 2016 through 31 December 2021.\n\n### Time\nA month is 30 days, and a year is 360 days.[^4]\n\n[^4]: This might be over the top but at some point your statistical programmer will have to decide on how to compute age, length of follow-up etc. if units of time are unspecified. Avoiding \"months\" will often be a good idea if possible, then a year can be 365 days (or 365.25 days to account for leap years) without having confusion as to how long a month needs to be for a year to equal 12 months.\n\n### Exposure groups\n*\tSGLT2i (exposure)\n*\tGLP-1RA (comparator)\n\n### Study population and index date\nWe will include individuals initiating SGLT2i or GLP-1RA during the study period using the inclusion-/exclusion steps below. The population is restricted to individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because SGLT2i is also indicated for heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We assume that restricting to this specific population of individual with a priori increased risk of infections will reduce confounding. Individuals with heart failure or CKD will not be excluded in the primary analysis.\n\n1.\tExtract data on the exposures from the prescription registry.\n2.\tSelect the first ever date per person, this marks the index date of the individual.\n3.\tExclude individuals who, on the index date:\n    a.\tinitiate both drugs\n    b.\thave incomplete CRS data (sex or date of birth missing)\n    c.\tare aged < 18 years\n    d.\tdo not have T2DM\n    e.\thave type 1 diabetes mellitus\n    f.\thave had either plague or cholera in the previous 3 months\n    g.\tdo not live in Denmark.\n4.\tInclude individuals whose index date lies in the recruitment period.[^5]\n\n[^5]: Note how the dates are not written here - they are defined in @sec-period and we seek to avoid repetitions.\n\nIndividuals will be assigned to exposure groups based on the prescription they received on the index date. At this point, check that there are at least 10,000 individuals in each exposure group. If this is not the case, we need to make sure that the correct codes have been used.\n\n\\[Here you might want to include a study diagram like @fig-studydiagram.[^6] However, it is repetitious by nature and as such it may not serve any particular purpose when the design is simple. If the design is more complex, a study diagram can serve as visual aid in explaining it.\\]\n\n[^6]: The colors and notation in @fig-studydiagram are not the ones typically used. No particular thought has been put into the current design.\n\n![Study diagram](./figs/studydiagram.png){#fig-studydiagram}\n\n### Follow-up and outcomes\nFor plague and cholera (the events of interest), separately, individuals will be followed from their index date until the first of: event of interest, emigration from Denmark, death, end of study period or 5 years, whichever comes first.\n\nSee the Outcomes section in @tbl-codingtable for definitions of plague and cholera. Death and emigration will be captured in the CRS.\n\n### Statistical analyses\nThe flowchart (@fig-flowchart) will be populated.\n\nThe population will be described as outlined in @tbl-tblshell1. Continuous variables will be reported by their median and interquartile intervals (Q1-Q3), while categorical variables will be reported with counts and percentages. For dichotomous variables, only one level will be presented (e.g., only the number of females, not males, and only numbers with prevalent heart failure, not numbers without, will be reported), whereas all levels will be presented for variables with more than two levels.\n\nThe outcomes will be analyzed using time to event methods, applying stabilized inverse probability of treatment (sIPT) weighting and multivariable adjustment to handle confounding. Specifically, sIPT weighted cause-specific Cox regression with confounder adjustment (see below) will be used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for each event of interest, along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The results will be reported as outlined in @tbl-tblshell2. Using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and sIPT-weighting, we will plot absolute risks against time, as outlined in @fig-riskcurves. No crude/unadjusted outcome analyses will be conducted.\n\nThe sIPT weights will be estimated using logistic regression including the exposure as the dependent variable, and the variables listed in @tbl-tblshell1 as independent variables. Continuous variables will be included as restricted cubic splines with knots placed at the deciles of their distributions (to be reconsidered if insufficient balance is achieved after sIPT weighting). Interaction terms will be included for age and sex; age and heart failure; heart failure and duration of T2DM; age and CKD; CKD and duration of T2DM; and country of origin and age.\n\nWe will use absolute standardized mean differences (ASMDs) to assess balance of baseline variables before and after sIPT weighting (@fig-ASMD). All sIPT weighted ASMDs must be below 0.1 and the ASMDs for age, sex, country of origin, heart failure, and CKD must be less than 0.01 to proceed to the outcome analyses. If this is not achieved, possible alternatives[^7] to an overall logistic regression model will be discussed and investigated.\n\n[^7]: Consider specifying.\n\n*Based on the populated versions of @tbl-tblshell1, @fig-flowchart, and @fig-ASMD, the entire author group must agree that the study population is reasonable with respect to size and characteristics, and that balance between exposure groups is sufficient, before any outcome analysis is carried out.*[^8]\n\n[^8]: To prevent p-hacking or HARKing, consider deciding *a priori* on certain intermediate milestones where analyses will be paused, and findings/results so far will be discussed in the group. In this way you can prevent yourself from changing the analyses after seeing the primary results, when it could have been done at an earlier stage.\n\nFor added robustness, sIPT weighting will be combined with multivariable adjustment when applying the cause-specific Cox regression. However, we expect relatively few outcomes, so we will only adjust for sex, age and country of origin, and age will be included as restricted cubic splines with 4 knots placed as suggested by Frank Harrell in Regression modelling strategies.\n\nThe proportionality assumption will be assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. If proportionality cannot be achieved, the 5-year risk estimates from the Aalen-Johansen estimator for each exposure group will be compared to obtain a 5-year risk ratio.[^9]\n\n[^9]: Often this is what you would do anyway when using PS-weighting or -matching. Cox-regression is primarily mentioned to point out that PS-methods can be combined with a multivariable outcome-model.\n\nFor stratified analyses and sensitivity analyses restricted to subgroups, we will re-estimate the sIPT weights. We will assess the balance of baseline variables in these subgroup analyses using ASMDs. However, we will not re-evaluate the methods if sufficient balance cannot be achieved. Instead, any imbalance will be reported in the manuscript or supplementary material. Outcome analyses will be conducted regardless of the ASMD-values.\n\nAll 95% CIs will be estimated using bootstrapping with 500 repetitions.\n\nThe statistical analyses will be conducted using [SAS/R/Stata] version X.X or higher.\n\n#### Missing data\nWe expect the level of missingness to be low.\n\n*\tFor comorbidities and comedication, absence of a record within the lookback period is assumed to be indicative of absence of the condition; missingness will be 0% by definition.\n*\tKnown age and sex are required for inclusion; missingness will be 0% by definition.\n*\tWe include biomarkers that are expected to be measured regularly for individuals with T2DM, missingness is expected to be less than 20% for all biomarkers.\n\nWe will apply multiple imputation,[^10] constructing and analyzing 10 data sets. Results across imputed data sets will be aggregated using Rubin's rule.\n\n[^10]: More details should be provided.\n\n#### Stratified analyses\nWe will estimate risks and conduct cause specific Cox-regressions stratifying on sex, country of origin and age (<65 years versus 65+ years). These results will be reported as outlined in @fig-forestplot. To assess treatment effect heterogeneity, we will include interaction terms for the exposure and each of these variables in separate cause specific Cox models and report the point estimate and 95% CI.[^11]\n\n[^11]: Or however you want to do that. If you simply go for eyeballing you might want to rewrite/shorten this section a bit.\n\n#### Sensitivity analyses\nThese sensitivity analyses are to be applied to the overall analysis only, stratifications will not be repeated within subgroups or in on-treatment analyses. Result will be reported as outlined in @tbl-tblshell3.\n\nWe will conduct a complete case analysis.\n\nAs we lack data on BMI, and we assume GLP-1RA is associated with higher levels of BMI, we will repeat the analysis within individuals with an obesity diagnosis.\n\nWe will restrict the analysis to individuals without a diagnosis of heart failure or CKD, to increase the likelihood that the indication for drug initiation was T2DM.\n\nFinally, we will conduct an on-treatment analysis. For this analysis an individual will be censored on the date they switch from one exposure drug to the other, or if they discontinue the treatment they initiated on the index date (index treatment).
